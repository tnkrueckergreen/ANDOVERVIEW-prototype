*Welcome to a new component of the ANDOVERVIEW newspaper! Club of the Month is a small section that will advertise a different club each month to help and promote the amazing clubs this school has to offer.*

Asian Culture Club is run by Vivian Tang and Jacqueline Zhu, and advised by Lin Wu. This club is meant to inspire interest in Asian culture, traditions, and people, as well as their values! Club members can do anything from watching movies from Asian movie studios (Studio Ghibli as an example) to playing traditional games from all around Asia to eating some amazing Asian cuisine.

“My favorite aspect of the club is educating myself and others about the importance of diversity,” said Tang. Creating environments that welcome all different backgrounds is one of the club’s biggest goals. Allowing all ethnicities to come together and learn about each other’s cultures and finding similarities is something this club strives to do every meeting!

Meeting times: Tuesday 3-3:30 p.m. in room 305

*If you want your club to be featured as club of the month, you can contact ANDOVERVIEW at [andoverview@andoverma.us](mailto:andoverview@andoverma.us) or through the contact page on our website.*
