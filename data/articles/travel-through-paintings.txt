The AHS National Art Honor Society created a series of beautiful posters showcasing destinations around the world through different art styles and a variety of art materials.

“We can’t do a mural this year because of COVID so we decided to do different places around the world as posters to let people see the other places in the world without leaving Andover,” said Madison Redler, senior and vice president of NAHS.
