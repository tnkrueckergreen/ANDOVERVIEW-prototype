Lauren Peithmann, the new music and choral instructor at Andover High School, started working at AHS towards the end of the second semester, filling the hole in the music department left by the previous choral instructor. As a new teacher at AHS, she is excited to bring a new passion to the music department for her students.

### What was your school life like?

“I always wanted to be a music teacher. My parents are both music educators so it seemed like a natural fit for me! After high school, I attended Ithaca College and majored in music education.”

### What was your first job?

“My first job was teaching middle school chorus and music classes in Byfield, Massachusetts… I was working directly with middle schoolers but I also assisted with the high school musical [after school]. My office was in the same room as the high school chorus teacher and high school theater teacher, which was great. Both teachers were very helpful and we also had a lot of laughs. I also was able to help out with the high school musical and I enjoyed that experience too.”

### What drew you to teaching students in music education?

“I love music and I love making music with students! I find great joy in rehearsing a piece with a chorus and then watching them perform it on stage. High school students have so much energy and enthusiasm for what they do. It’s inspiring!”

### What is your favorite part of teaching music to students?

“Teaching singing is tough because everyone’s voice is different. You also can’t touch or see a person’s vocal cords. It can be a challenge to troubleshoot and help everyone work on their own individual voice. I like the challenge though. It’s so exciting to hear a student’s voice change and grow over time.”

### What brought you to AHS?

“Prior to working here, I was an arts administrator and I was working mostly behind the scenes to help things run smoothly. While I loved seeing the progress of the students and supporting staff members, I missed conducting, teaching, and making music on a regular basis with students. So when I saw this position open up, I applied!”

### What would you like to accomplish as a music teacher?

“I would like to leave a legacy of students who remember their time in chorus fondly, who perhaps are patrons of the arts in their own communities, and who still make music either professionally or just for fun. I like to think that the influence of a good teacher ripples out into the world. I hope that my students keep making and enjoying music their whole lives.”

### Do you have a favorite musical composition piece?

“I really love piano music. *Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto #2* is one of my favorite pieces of music.”

### What is your favorite free time activity?

“I like to hang out with my daughters and support them in their activities. They like to swim, dance, sing, and act. We’re pretty busy!”
