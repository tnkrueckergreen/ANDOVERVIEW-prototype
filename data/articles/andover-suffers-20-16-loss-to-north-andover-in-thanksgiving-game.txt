The first half was a showdown between Andover junior Nick Ilsley and North Andover senior Benjamin Iglesias, with both teams exchanging touchdowns in the first quarter. After Andover’s opening drive ended at North Andover’s 26-yard line with a turnover on downs, Iglesias scored on a 71-yard run for North Andover. Taking snaps at quarterback in the Wildcat formation due to injuries to senior starter Dominic Papa and sophomore back-up Kyle Olson, Ilsley responded with a 54-yard kickoff return, which set up his own three-yard touchdown run to tie the game 7-7.

The second quarter started with chaos: North Andover lost 54 yards on three consecutive bad snaps, leading to a safety and a two-point lead for Andover. On the following kickoff, Ilsley returned a squib kick back into the endzone for a 63-yard touchdown, making the score 16-7. Just five minutes later, Iglesias answered with a touchdown of his own, with the 84-yard scoring run cutting their deficit down to 16-14. Later, with nine seconds left on the clock, North Andover attempted a field goal, but the ball doinked the left goalpost and bounced out, leaving the score unchanged.

Although the game was tight in the first half, North Andover took control in the second. North Andover’s quarterback, junior Billy Vincent, led a 70-yard drive that resulted in the touchdown that ended up becoming the game-winning score. Ilsley’s injury and North Andover’s key defensive plays, including two forced turnovers in the final 90 seconds of the game, secured the victory. A strip sack by North Andover at Andover’s own 12-yard line sealed the game, handing Andover its first loss to North Andover since their 2021 matchup at Fenway Park.

Football Coach Ernest Perry provided insight into the history and tradition of the Thanksgiving game. “The Thanksgiving Day game has been a tradition for over 100 years,” he said, recalling its roots when Andover and North Andover were part of the same town. For Perry, the game encapsulates the “camaraderie and memories” that make high school football unforgettable.

Perry detailed how the team’s seniors ran their final lap in practice, with younger teammates forming a tunnel to honor them before the game. “It’s emotional… but we try to do it the day before,” he said.

The game’s importance extends beyond the field. Perry reminisced about past unforgettable moments, like the dramatic 2015 game where Andover edged out a 42-41 victory with a last-second defensive stop. “Some of these guys have played together for 10 years,” Perry said.

“No matter what happens, I tell all these guys, ‘You’ll remember your Thanksgiving [Games].’ You’ll always have the memory of the guys [you played with], and these games will always come back to you.”
