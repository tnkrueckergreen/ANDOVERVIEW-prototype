Andover High School has implemented a new tardy policy allowing students who arrive after 8:15 A.M. to go straight to class. The goal is to maximize learning time by reducing delays at the tardy desk.

If students arrive after the 8:15 bell, they will be sent directly to class where teachers will mark them tardy, instead of wasting time waiting at the tardy desk. The decision to change the policy was made when Principal Jimmy D’Andrea came to the school as the new principal this past summer collectively by the administration.

According to Assistant Principal Joanna Ganci, “One of the things that we talked about this summer when Mr. D’Andrea came was just the amount of time that the tardy line was taking, and it was delaying students from getting right to class. And obviously, we want to maximize the amount of time students are in class.” Ganci does not think of this idea as a policy but rather as a process.

Ralph Bledsoe, a science teacher at AHS, echoed similar sentiments. “Bottom line is, instead of having the tardy desk from 8:15 to 8:30 where they’re standing in line, [the policy] allows them to get to class as opposed to being held up, [which] makes sense to me,” said Bledsoe.

However, according to sophomore Elly Lenihan, some teachers do not mark her tardy when she arrives at her classroom late. “I’m usually a minute late to school at least once a week, and I don’t get marked tardy anymore because it’s just one minute, so teachers usually let it slide,” she said. “Last year I was marked tardy a lot because of the old policy.”
