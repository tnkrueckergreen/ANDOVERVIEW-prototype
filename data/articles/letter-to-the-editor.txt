Description: A sophomore argues that the school newspaper should avoid controversial and political stories.

One of the opinion columns in the May issue of *ANDOVERVIEW* was questionably appropriate. The specific piece I refer to is that covering the “Oval Office Showdown.” I have an issue with this because I find it contentious that the school newspaper is taking on stories that are deeply controversial and political. I get that this was an opinion piece, but is there no way to have an opinion section without the discussion of political issues?

These kinds of stories only serve to rattle people up, and I think that it’s likely not the greatest thing to do, especially when this is a school newspaper. There are people at AHS who have diverse views on things like this, and I think that it’s wrong when things such as the school newspaper, which should be speaking for the whole student body, chooses to focus on one set of partisan views. This is made clear as there was only one view expressed throughout. Shouldn’t the school newspaper try to steer clear of things like this?
