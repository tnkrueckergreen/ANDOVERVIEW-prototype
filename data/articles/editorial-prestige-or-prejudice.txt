In a wealthy town like Andover, there is often pressure to go to a prestigious college. Whether it’s Andover’s proximity to Phillips Academy, family pressure, friends who take seventeen AP classes, or the general vibes, it often feels like in order to be considered a “smart” person you need to go into debt to attend a top ten college. You need to go to a prestigious school instead of prioritizing somewhere that would fit you better socially or financially. Many adults around you emphasize that where you go for your undergraduate degree is the be all end all of whether you will be successful in life.

State schools and especially community colleges get a bad reputation, but they are not bad schools and can have excellent programs. They also have a great program called “$30,000 a year tuition.” Community colleges are awesome—you can pay a manageable tuition for two years and save money for living at home. In 20 years, no employer will care where you got your associate’s degree. If you go to community college then transfer to a four-year state school, you can even receive special Massachusetts scholarships.

Instead of trying to get into a college that will probably cost a kidney, focus on going to a school that has awesome programs, is in a cool city, or wants to give you a huge scholarship. Or maybe you don’t want to go to college, which is also awesome! Go to trade school, which is probably the most economic choice.
