Description: Elon Musk replaces senior federal employees with high school interns.

In his first administrative action, Musk unveiled a sweeping staffing plan, phasing out GS-13 through GS-15 federal employees in favor of unpaid high school interns from AHS. Musk said he was in part inspired by his Tesla autopilot rerouting him through Massachusetts during one of his frequent “tweet and drive” sessions. “Their school mascot is the Golden Warriors, which sounds disruptive enough,” he added.

Musk was unapologetic when explaining his staffing decision at the press conference. “Professional experience is, statistically speaking, time spent developing institutional habits that need fixing,” he said. “Our research shows that a 16-year-old with a calculator can make most government decisions just as well.”

In return, the DOGE recruitment program offers what Musk describes as “competitive non-monetary compensation”: a line on college applications that reads “Federal Decision Maker,” among other things, such as pizza parties on Fridays.

A select few will be permitted to launch paperwork into space via SpaceX rockets. “We *must* get rid of government clutter,” Musk said.

To accelerate matters, the department has created RedTapeX, an artificial intelligence that will help interns identify redundancies in federal workflows. Initial trials of RedTapeX, a version fine-tuned from Musk’s X-exclusive “Grok” AI, have produced unexpected results. After studying the structure of federal organizations, the AI took to X and recommended the immediate dissolution of DOGE, labeling it as a “redundancy within redundancies.”

“It’s very committed,” Musk said, when questioned about the AI’s revelatory announcement. “It knows what it’s trained to do. Maybe we were overfitting, but of course, it’s not going to be *perfect* on day one.” He declined further comment.

The program will officially start next term, pending completion of all permission slips from parents. Those are currently being processed by RedTapeX at an estimated rate of three forms per week; Musk expects to double, if not triple, that throughput with optimizations.

The press conference concluded with Musk detailing his plans for “70% of staff in every federal department being replaced by high school interns no later than 2028.” Musk is known for his unrealistic timelines, such as his 2019 promise of one million Tesla robotaxis on the road by 2020. Interestingly, that never happened. Experts expect Musk’s DOGE timeline to extend well into the 2030s, assuming the program survives its first constitutional challenge, expected to be filed by a coalition of federal employee unions and parents who discover their children have been algorithmically selected for positions at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Musk’s rationale is justified, according to Musk. “The thing about government—and this is just basic physics really—is that decision-making efficiency decreases exponentially with each additional hour spent thinking about it. The great thing about teenagers is that they don’t think. And they do it for free. The ROI is *insane*.”
