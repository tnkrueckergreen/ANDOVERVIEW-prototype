We’ve all had classmates whip up an essay in barely five minutes with the “help” of ChatGPT, while you actually write yours, only for them to get a better grade. It can be frustrating to see your hard work have a less fruitful production than the AI-generated essay, but in the end, the choices people make say a lot about their sense of honesty and integrity.

Some students think that ChatGPT is a perfect alternative to actually writing their assignments, because it is undetectable cheating. However, AI-detection softwares have been in development and catching some students. This emphasizes that ChatGPT is highly formulaic, so much that it can be picked up by other softwares. Not only could you get caught, the work will also be of worse quality.

And, of course, if you let the AI do your assignments for you, you aren’t actually doing the work. While that may be the point of using it in the first place, and it definitely can get your homework done faster, it may not be done as well, and you will be lacking the actual learning and comprehension skills
gained from completing the assignment.

In the end, it is not worth it to expect the same quality of work from ChatGPT than if you do it yourself, and if you do use it, you could be at risk of getting caught. The benefits don’t outweigh the negatives in this case, and if you really don’t have time for finishing an assignment, try talking to your teacher or guidance counselor about it instead of relying on an AI program to do it for you. The point of writing assignments is to apply your skills and knowledge. People who do put in the work deserve to take pride in it, rather than getting a worse grade than someone who put in close to none.
