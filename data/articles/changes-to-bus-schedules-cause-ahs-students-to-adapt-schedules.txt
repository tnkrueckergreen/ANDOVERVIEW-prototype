From the beginning of the current school year, shifts in bus schedules and a shortage of bus drivers have led to changes in the activities and schedules of Andover High School students.

As early as September, AHS students who took the bus had been arriving late to school. Recently, morning bus schedules have improved, but now many buses have to combine routes or find substitute drivers to take students back home. As a result of the decline in available bus drivers, some clubs and after-school activities have had to make adaptations to regular club affairs.

AHS sophomore Megan Zhang uses the bus regularly and is a member of the math and science teams. “Usually the most fun part of the clubs [is] traveling, then meeting up with other people and enjoying the meets,” she said. However, with the shortage of buses and bus drivers, things are a little different. This year, she said that “[the math and science teams] haven’t been able to [travel] because of bus shortages.”

Cindy Button, the transportation manager for the Andover Public School district, said that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to several changes in bus schedules and routes this year. “Our transportation services, Trombly and North Reading Transit (NRT), have been experiencing staffing shortages since the start of the school year,” Button said. She explains that this isn’t just a challenge for Andover; the entire country is experiencing similar setbacks.

In addition to these shortages, Button mentioned other changes to schedules that have worsened the situation for many drivers. A few months ago, the School Committee voted to adjust start timings during the school year. Button believes that “ it is important for students and families to know that while Trombly services Andover Public Schools, they service private schools in town as well.” These private schools have different school day schedules compared to Andover Public Schools, which requires more adjustment from services like Trombly to take students to and from school.

“Trombly also services many additional cities and towns in the Merrimack Valley,” added Button. “This adds more logistics to providing service to all these students and families.”

Button states that the priority of our bus services is to find the most efficient way to get students to school and back home safely. “Trombly and NRT do their best to make sure all of our bus routes have coverage every day,” said Button. “We are hoping that as the pandemic subsides, things will smooth out and become more consistent for our families.”
