Black Student Union (BSU) was started at the beginning of this school year by Gabrielle Erawoc and Jainaba Conteh. In BSU, students have discussions about Black issues in Andover High School and share their experiences. When students bring up concerns, the club takes action to fix them.

During February, BSU talked about a famous Black person every day in the morning announcements, and they hope to do similar projects in the future.

BSU member Aisosa Oviasogie described the club as a very welcoming place. “[BSU is] a good place to comfortably talk about your experiences,” Oviasogie said.

BSU meets every Tuesday after school in room 301. Meetings run until 3:30 p.m. For more information about BSU, you can email the club leaders: [jconteh2023@k12.andoverma.us](mailto:jconteh2023@k12.andoverma.us) and [gerawoc2023@k12.andoverma.us](mailto:gerawoc2023@k12.andoverma.us).
