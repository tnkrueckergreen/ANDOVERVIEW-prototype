Over February vacation, five AHS varsity sports competed for the Merrimack Valley Championship in a hard fought battle to defend previous titles and achieve new ones. The winter sports season included boys/girls basketball, boys/girls hockey, boys swimming, gymnastics, and skiing. Many of these athletes were forced to alter the basics of their game, because of the restrictions of COVID-19 and looking out for everyone’s safety, especially in high contact sports. Even despite these alterations and restrictions, both hockey, basketball, and gymnastics teams advanced to the final MVC championship.

#### **Gymnastics (Won, 141.25-137.75)**

The AHS gymnastics team won against North Andover 141.35-137.75, led by freshman duo Gabby Bresnick and Molly Foster. Foster placed highest in the beam, scoring a 9.2, while Bresnick placed second in vault and bars, 9.35 and 9.05 respectively. North Andover has a powerful All-Star athlete, Kasey Burke, who won the all around, vault, bars, and floor, yet Andover was able to work together as a team to finish on top.

#### **Boys Basketball (Lost, 39-37)**

The Warriors faced off against rival Central Catholic in a highly competitive and anticipated game that ended in a two-point deficit. The game remained close throughout the first three quarters and was tied 36-36 with two minutes to go. From here, Central just barely escaped with the win, allowing them to receive their first MVC Division 1 Cup. The Warriors ended their season 11-1, led by longtime coach Dave Fazio.

#### **Girls Basketball (Lost, 36-33 OT)**

The Lady Warriors also faced longtime rival Central Catholic for the second time this season. The Warriors had a successful season, winning nine games and only losing three, including this championship game. Last season, the Warriors trekked their way through the playoffs all the way to the state championship game, played at local arenas such as the Tsongas Center and TD Garden, and made a statement by making it to the MVC championship game yet again. The Raiders were led by breakout star freshman Ashley Dinges, who scored the final three points resulting in their win. The Warriors were led by senior guard Tatum Shaw, and sophomores Amelia Hanscom and Anna Foley.

#### **Boys Hockey (Lost, 3-2)**

The Warriors took the lead in an intense game against Chelmsford, with senior Ryan O’Sullivan making a goal in the first period to get Andover off on a good foot. Chelmsford made a statement in return, with the Lions scoring three consecutive goals from senior players. Andover made an attempt to close it out, with senior Steve Ingram making it 3-2, but they were unable to overcome Chelmsford, ending their season 2-5-1.

#### **Girls Hockey (Lost, 3-2)**

The girls varsity hockey team lost in a hard-fought battle against Billerica/Chelmsford, ending their season 8-4-1. The team got the opportunity to play at the Tsongas Center on February 21, and scored within the first four minutes, junior Jaqui Haney putting the first point on the board. Billerica/Chelmsford immediately struck back and the game took off from there, a back and forth exchange that lasted until the very end. Senior Kalli Archambault scored within the last three minutes, but the team was not able to score again to overcome Chelmsford.
