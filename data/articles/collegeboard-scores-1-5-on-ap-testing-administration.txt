Description: CollegeBoard’s AP exam tech failures and unauthorized use of an author’s work highlight serious flaws in their testing system.

“Once you enter the start code, you may begin.” With these words, hundreds of AP Psychology students at AHS expected to start their AP exam. Instead, they were greeted by a laggy, glitchy BlueBook testing app that refused to cooperate. For the students who were unable to coax the app into functioning, the exam was delayed to May 21—a poor solution for students who spent a whole year preparing for that moment.

We at ANDOVERVIEW believe that the fragile testing infrastructure of CollegeBoard is absolutely unacceptable. One would assume that a nonprofit organization that claims to be “paving the path for college success” would ensure that its testing platform relies upon servers that are able to handle the increased traffic on testing day. CollegeBoard provided very little consolation to the adrenaline-crashing students. “Most students have had a successful testing experience, with more than 5 million exams being successfully submitted thus far,” the organization defended. The statement was tellingly short—PR representatives at CollegeBoard couldn’t be bothered to devote any longer than a five-minute coffee break to drafting this “apology.”

Unfortunately, technical glitches are not the only issues that CollegeBoard has encountered this AP season. After a slew of hate comments were slung in author Namwali Serpell’s direction, she discovered that the vitriol was directed towards one particular passage in one of her books. The infamous “Look at Me” passage was recognized by this year’s AP Lang students as an indecipherable jumble of content followed by some seriously difficult multiple-choice questions (MCQs). After learning this, Serpell revealed that CollegeBoard had included the passage in the test without her permission and distorted its meaning in the MCQs that followed. Adding insult to injury, Serpell also clearly stated that she was against standardized testing as a concept. As of late May, CollegeBoard had yet to address these comments.

The negligence of CollegeBoard has created a sorrowful state of affairs for those looking to take advantage of the benefits of AP courses and exams. To no one’s surprise, the corporatization of education has introduced far more harm than benefit to all involved. We can only hope that CollegeBoard will hear and address some students’ criticisms.
