Former Andover High School student Christopher Shepley, Class of 2024, has announced his renewed candidacy for the upcoming School Committee election in March. Following his previous run in the 2024 election, Shepley is now focusing his 2025 campaign on fiscal responsibility, community trust, and a fresh perspective. ANDOVERVIEW had the opportunity to interview him on October 20 to further discuss his platform.

### You have mentioned plans to address the anticipated $1 million deficit in the APS FY2026 budget without compromising educational quality and while protecting student-facing positions as one of your key points heading into this election. How specifically do you intend to accomplish this balance?

As a member of the School Committee, I would be committed to ensuring Andover students remain the number one priority. During the budgeting process, I will advocate for protecting student-facing positions and upholding crucial student services, such as athletics and the arts. I believe our school budget is rife with misspending, particularly with unnecessary and expensive consultants, law firms, and an inefficient central administration. I would actively look to make cuts in those areas while prioritizing our services for students.

### You’ve emphasized communication and accountability within the administration. How would you improve transparency between the School Committee and the community?

The first step to rebuilding trust in our APS community is giving stakeholders an active voice in decision-making. If I’m elected, I will pursue the creation of an advisory board for the School Committee, which would be made up of representatives from students, educators, parents, and community members. This would allow for a robust dialogue and aid the committee’s decision-making process. I would also push for more transparency during collective bargaining and advocate for all bargaining sessions to be held in full view of the public.

### The School Committee is responsible for evaluating the superintendent’s yearly performance, so what measurable goals do you believe should be prioritized in the superintendent’s evaluation? Can you give examples of what you would consider a successful evaluation?

The School Committee’s most important task is the superintendent’s annual evaluation. It is clear to me that Dr. Parvey has lost the confidence of Andover educators and a large portion of the community. Rebuilding that trust will be a long process, but I am confident that change is possible. If elected, I promise to leave no stone unturned and will hold the superintendent accountable for every decision made. While standardized tests such as the MCAS can be necessary for tracking student performance, I want to go further than test scores and introduce district-wide surveys on the superintendent’s performance. The committee can be better informed during her evaluation by fielding input from students, educators, and parents.

### As a recent graduate of APS, what specific changes do you believe are needed in the district? How would your firsthand experience help guide these improvements?

I am proud to have gone through Andover Public Schools and am thankful for my excellent education over the years. However, I know there are areas where we can improve. Mental health is crucial for academic success, and we need to offer more support for our students. I support more guidance counselors and social workers in our schools, as well as increasing available resources. Furthermore, I believe our curriculum needs to adapt to our ever-changing world. By further integrating financial literacy and civics into our curriculum, we can better prepare our students for lifelong success.

### Reflecting on the last election, what lessons have you learned from that experience, and how do you plan to apply it to your campaign this time around to ensure a successful outcome?

Running for office in the 2024 election was indeed a fantastic experience. I met so many great people in town and learned valuable life skills. Learning from my previous run, I want to incorporate a more significant social media presence to get my message out to the community. The 2024 election saw over 5,000 Andover residents get out to vote, a massive jump from previous elections. With so many engaged voters, I understand that face-to-face interaction is the best way to reach people. In my last election, I knocked on around 300 doors. This time around, my goal is to knock on 3,000.
