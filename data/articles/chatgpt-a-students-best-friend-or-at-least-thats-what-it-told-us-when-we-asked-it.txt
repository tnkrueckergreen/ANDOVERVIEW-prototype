Able to write essays, solve math problems, find solutions for everyday problems, and do anything else you might need help with, ChatGPT is truly a jack of all trades. Though released only two years ago, ChatGPT, along with other AI platforms, is now thoroughly integrated into nearly every AHS student’s life. Yet students and teachers disagree on what is considered academic dishonesty regarding AI.

When asked about its usefulness to students, ChatGPT said, “With the ability to adapt to individual needs, I am an indispensable tool that helps students thrive both in and outside the classroom, making their lives more manageable and their educational journey more successful.”

“I use ChatGPT every single day. It’s always open on my computer” said a sophomore who asked to remain anonymous, explaining that they even made a new Google account just for ChatGPT because they always run out of free usage. “I think it’s been a good three weeks where I’ve used ChatGPT during every single period,” they added. They like to use AI to complete math homework, fix their code, and write foreign language assignments. “For essays, I’ll write them, but if the words don’t look good, I’ll put it in ChatGPT to rephrase it, but then I’ll rephrase it [again]. I’m not a cheater,” they said.

One junior explained that he doesn’t like to use AI often in his schoolwork, typically using it no more than three times a week, mostly to check essays before turning them in. He sees many of his classmates misusing AI more than he does, yet they all get the same grades on assignments. “I feel like everyone else is taking the easy way but I’m really doing the work. I feel like I’m not getting enough credit for the work I actually do compared to my classmates who use ChatGPT,” he said.

Many AHS teachers are also noticing students’ frequent AI usage.

“When I taught, I definitely noticed [AI] used every class, I’d say a few times,” said Michael McCarthy, who taught at AHS for 19 years before recently becoming the K-12 social studies director.

French teacher Olga Kostousova said she can always tell when a student used AI in their work. Though she tries to make “AI-proof” assignments, students continue to use it. Kostousova told a story of a student who submitted a paragraph that began with “Because I am AI, I am unable to answer this question…”

Yet students aren’t the only ones who’ve taken advantage of the all-knowing ChatGPT.

Kostousova, who likes to use AI to brainstorm assignments and activities for her classes,

said, “Artificial intelligence is my co-teacher.” She actually wishes ChatGPT was stronger. “AI is not yet what I want it to be … oftentimes I’m unsatisfied with ChatGPT’s results,” she stated. Other faculty like McCarthy stay away from using AI in their work. “I feel like if I’m going to ask students not to use it, then I need to model that as well,” he said.

According to a 2023 *Forbes* magazine article, 89 percent of US high schoolers have had ChatGPT do their homework for them, and 53% have used it to write their essays. Yet AHS students and teachers disagree on what counts as cheating. While the previously quoted sophomore believes that, as long as AI isn’t fully doing your work for you, there’s no problem, English teacher Caitlin Mitchell said that anything beyond basic spell-check isn’t ok. The aforementioned junior thinks AI should be fully banned from school.

When asked about its thoughts on being banned, ChatGPT said, “I think I *should* be allowed in schools but with clear guidelines ensuring I support students’ education rather than replacing their effort.”

As students use AI more and more, teachers are worrying about the long-term effects of its usage. McCarthy is worried that it will take over students’ thinking, and Mitchell is scared that students will one day reach a point where they can’t use AI, and then they won’t know what to do. The concerned junior added, “We’re not going to be maximizing our potential as students and as a generation.”

Kostousova is very upset by students who don’t do their own work. “They will ruin their knowledge,” she said.

The sophomore, though saying that AI will make us as students lazier, still thinks it makes us better. “Everyone who says that AI brings you down academically is straight-capping (lying),” they claimed. The sophomore revealed their dependence on ChatGPT. “I can’t do anything without it,” they said.

If caught using AI to cheat on assignments, AHS students face serious consequences. According to the AHS Student Handbook, one infraction is marked on your record and gets you an F. Two infractions mean a minimum of 3 detentions and a 0 on the assignment. Three infractions mean a minimum of a 1-day suspension and a meeting with the principal. Any infraction leads to being kicked out of the National Honor Society.

When asked if they’ve been caught, the sophomore said, “Not by a teacher, I’m very slick about it.”

Mitchell compares AI usage to “The Tortoise and the Hare.” “The hare (ChatGPT users) might get ahead faster, but at the end of the day, the tortoise, or the kids that didn’t ever use it, are going to gain the skills,” she explained.

ChatGPT seems to agree. “I’m your smartest friend, but letting me do your homework is how we both fail the class,” it said.
