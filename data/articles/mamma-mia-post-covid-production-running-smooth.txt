Andover High School’s 2021 theater production, *Mamma Mia!*, is going great in a post-COVID-19 year as the November 18 debut grows closer.

The cast and supporting crew of *Mamma Mia!* were more ready than ever to pick back up with shows as they were before the COVID-19 pandemic. Tessa Barcelo, a senior and lead role in the play explained that the acting crew had settled back into pre-COVID theatre well and was making notable progress towards a great production despite the setbacks last year.

“We’ve learned to roll with the punches,” Barcelo said, “[The production] has gone right back to the Collins Center stage, so we feel at home again.”

The production this year is not without its difficulties, and according to Barcelo, wearing masks during the performance has an impact on the cast’s ability to sing. However, she and other cast members have found workarounds for the potential issues of wearing masks on stage that still ensure COVID safety. “Disposable masks, because they’re more flexible, let you open your mouth more and sing better than the cloth masks,” Barcelo noted, “They’re better for projecting.”

This year there have been a few notable additions to the production staff that according to the Director of Arts at AHS, Susan Choquette, have helped boost the potential for the show. “Typically Mr. Desjardins is the musical director of the play, but he recently just had a baby,” Choquette said, “…so I invited a colleague of mine,…Thom Smoker. He’s a great musician and singer, he works well with young voices, and also he’s now teaching music…at Berklee School of Music and Endicott College, so he’s really fitting us in.”

Choquette also explained that *Mamma Mia!* has a new choreographer, Stephanie Morris: the owner of the local dance studio Creative Arts Academy. “She’s working really hard because there’s a lot of dance in this show,” Choquette stated.

This year’s show has had a demanding regiment thus far, and according to Choquette, that was not likely to let up until the day of *Mamma Mia!* ’s debut. “Somebody’s rehearsing…six days a week, whether it’s me, or Thom, or Stephanie. Sometimes there are even two rehearsals in a day.” Choquette said, “We’re a busy group trying to get ready for this performance…it takes a village.”

Despite the strenuous schedule and minor COVID-related nuisances, *Mamma Mia!* ’s cast is keeping a positive mentality and has set the bar high for the production this year. Choquette described *Mamma Mia!* as the perfect fit for production in a post-pandemic year: heartwarming, well known, and all-around fun.

“What I’ve learned is that we can do anything,” Choquette said. “Bring on a global pandemic, we’re still going to make theater.”

Another major cast member of *Mamma Mia!*, Sadie Rooney, matched Choquette’s praise of the production’s progress thus far. “It’s been a long journey, but we have overcome a lot of the roadblocks put in our path by COVID… The sets and lighting this year are truly gorgeous and I’m so glad to be back on the stage.” Rooney said, “Because of the lack of theatre in many places last year, the cast is even bigger than ever and so excited to be performing once again.”

Rooney spoke for the entire cast when she described her excitement for this year’s production. “From what [the production staff]  have said to me, they seem to be just as excited as we are. They all give up so much time and energy to this production and we are all so incredibly grateful.” Rooney continued, “ABBA is a fan favorite for many, so I think *Mamma Mia!* is a perfect way to bring back theatre [to Andover].”

Barcelo, Choquette, Rooney, and the rest of *Mamma Mia!* ’s staff urge everyone available to check out the show and have exclaimed high expectations for this year’s production. “It’s such a fun show and not something you’ll want to miss!” Rooney concluded.
