Description: Betsey Desfosse is one of the health teachers at Andover High School.

Betsey Desfosse is one of the health teachers at Andover High School. Mrs. Desfosse has taught health for 32 years. In her free time, she loves to go outside and enjoy nature and walking her dogs. “ I think I am a very responsible person, and I grew up helping people around me as I help my aging parents and my niece with special needs,” she said.

### How did you become interested in becoming a Health Teacher?

I liked being a Sunday School teacher when I was in high school so I knew I liked to teach.  I just thought health was the most exciting and ever-changing topic.

### How long have you been teaching health?

I have been teaching health for around 32 years!

### How has health changed over the years?

The reason I wanted to teach health is because it changes all the time.  Over the years, there have been new issues, inventions, diseases, and current health issues to contend with.

### What do most people struggle with?

I think when I first started at AHS, I would say that kids were struggling with not being as happy as they could be.  That was the start of our mental health crisis.

### Were the causes for adults and children the same or different, if different, why?

Maybe the root cause is the same but presents differently based on someone’s age.

### Do you notice phones affecting people’s mental health? If so, how?

Massively!  They are not helping.  It breaks my heart to watch how unhappy and disconnected people are. I wish teenagers could grow up without a phone. I had the best childhood memories that kids today will never have.

### Have you ever struggled in terms of health?

Definitely with mental health and body image, but I have worked hard to be in a good place with both and [am] always happy to help anyone struggling!

### What do you think is the most important topic in Health?

I would say building skills to help yourself and others and knowing resources.
