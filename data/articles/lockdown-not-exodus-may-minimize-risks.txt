Description: On January 24, there was a Snapchat post threatening a shooting at dismissal time.

On January 24, there was a Snapchat post threatening a shooting at dismissal time. Law enforcement quickly determined the threat was not credible; however, the incident revealed some areas for improvement in our school’s emergency response procedures.

We are thankful for Principal D’Andrea’s commitment to keeping everyone informed throughout the incident. While according to D’Andrea, administration tried to follow ALICE protocol, their decisions caused safety concerns that might have been avoided.

AHS implemented an impromptu system—anyone could leave without dismissal passes. This led to students and parents congregating in the area where the threatened violence may well have occurred, creating exactly the type of crowded situation we should avoid during a potential active shooter scenario. Additionally, because of allowed dismissals, some students were motivated by the opportunity to leave school early.

We might want to consider the following changes in the event of a similar incident. First, students need to understand their responsibility to report threats immediately to school staff rather than allowing rumors to circulate around the school. Early reporting helps administrators assess situations quicker and implement appropriate responses.

Second, the administration should consider whether a lockdown might be more appropriate in similar situations. An expedited early dismissal might seem like the easiest solution given the circumstances, but it can create new risks and logistical challenges that compromise student safety.

Our school community showed both resilience and areas for growth during this incident. AHS can learn from this experience and implement changes that ensure a safer, more organized response to any future threats. As D’Andrea always says, the safety of our student body is always the highest priority, and that means continuously evaluating and improving our emergency response procedures.
