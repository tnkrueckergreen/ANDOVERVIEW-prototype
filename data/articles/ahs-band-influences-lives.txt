The Andover High School band has been around for many years and is a very important part of our school culture. Whether it be the marching band that plays in the football games or the concert bands that are spread throughout the year, it’s important for the students of AHS to get familiar with a few of the members behind the AHS band.

Arjun Chandra, a junior at AHS, has been playing saxophone for many years in the band and found that it helped him meet many great people. “I feel I always have someone to talk to,” said Chandra.

Chandra described his favorite experiences of making music with the AHS band. “Making music with my closest friends is a lot of fun,” said Chandra. His favorite piece of music to play with his bandmates is a song called “Canzona” that he played during his freshman year of high school.

A junior at AHS, May Wallace has also been a part of the AHS band for many years and has found that  it brings her a lot of positive energy.

Wallace described her future plans with the band and if she plans to continue her effort in music.

“I plan on continuing band for the rest of high school but I’m not sure for the future,” said Wallace.

Andover High School band director Jeffery Kuchan is new to AHS this year and is looking forward to a productive year of music. Kuchan had been involved with some form of band for many years of his life and shares why he loves being in the band room so much. “Band has always been a home for me. It’s been a place where I can explore, imagine, and be creative,” said Kuchan.

Kuchan explains what piqued his interest in being the band director for AHS. He explains that the community of Andover has much to offer in terms of music ability and he is hoping to help many young musicians develop and grow. “I love working with students who are always asking the big questions: *how*, *what*, and *why*,” said Kuchan.

Kuchan has been able to experience many things because of his passion for band. In high school, he was able to march in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and has memories of performing with his friends in the band. “My strongest and oldest friendships were forged through band, and being involved in the arts has opened many doors throughout my life,” said Kuchan.

Kuchan has high hopes for the future of the AHS band and their potential to make music. His main goal is to help the group of musicians have the most successful and memorable high school band. He hopes to inspire the kids to continue spreading music. “I see a lot of hungry music students [here] eager to try new things,” said Kuchan.
