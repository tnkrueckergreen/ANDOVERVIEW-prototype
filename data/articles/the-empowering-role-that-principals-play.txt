We are all in different places in our educational careers. Some of us are just starting high school, while others are getting ready to move on to college. But as we walk different paths forward, we have one thing that unites us; one thing that makes us all smile in the mornings, a constant presence in our lives. In the crowded hallways of AHS, we all can stand on common ground: our love of our new principal, Jimmy D’Andrea.

We believe he is the key to raising school spirit and community at AHS. This year will be filled with a continuation of the joy that Jimmy has brought so far, and we can’t wait to see it. His enthusiasm is infectious, as we see him show up game after game and concert after concert,  Every morning when we hear Jimmy’s bright voice over the loudspeaker, when he shows up time and again to sports events, concerts, and club meetings, his love for AHS is clear. He has demonstrated true care and commitment to the student body, even in his admittedly short term, and we love him for it.

Jimmy’s legacy at AHS has just begun, and we can’t wait to see him continue to build the school community.
